This blind man, an old friend my wife's, he was on his way to spend the night.His wife had died.So he was visiting the dead wife's relatives in Connecticut.He called my wife from his in-law's.
Arrangements were made.
He would come by train, a five-hour trip, and my wife would meet him at the station.
She hadn't seen him since she worked for him one summer in Seattle ten years ago.
But she and the blind man had kept in touch. They made tapes and mailed them back and forth.
I wasn't enthusiastic about his visit.
He was no one I knew. And his being blind bothered me.
My idea of blindness came from the movies.
In the movies, the blind moved slowly and never laughed.
